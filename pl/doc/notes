  lab/chat               Chat with each other - recorded for posterity
  lab/labbook            Record observations about the experiment
  lab/alarms             Recipe conditions were out of spec  
  lab/inputs/$IP         Edge Sensors/Channels - temperature, voltage, counter
  lab/outputs/$IP        Edge outputs - turn on LED, move motor, voltage
  lab/outputsRest/$IP    If device cannot fulfill output request - why?
  lab/user               Button, Slider, Text - physical devices or computer interface
  lab/configReq/$IP      Request configuration for an application or device - recipes - procedures
  lab/config/$IP         Return requested configuration information
  lab/admin              Reset device, status,
  lab/errors             Fatal program errors
  lab/warnings           Non-fatal program errors
  lab/debug              Debug messages for tracing program flow

Input widgets
  Buttons to turn on lights
  Slider to set LED light intensity 
  Slider to set blink rate 
  Arduino Reset 

Output widgets             
  LEDs on EPIC backpanel - Arduino builtin
  Gauge to show setting positions
  Multi-line graph of sensors - real time updates

Device page
=======================
List all devices
  Show status
  Show IP
  Show inputs
  Show outputs
  Reset button

Recipe page
=======================
Current status
Show all steps pf the recipe
Show the step we are currently on
Allow user to select the next step
If step cannot be selected show why

List DOE variants
=======================
   Each independent variable shows desired and current value - color coded
   User can select when operating conditions are met - this sets a timestamp in historian
